# E-commerce-console-Application
Learnable Backend Dev


Submitted as part of the requirements for the learnable Backend development internship.

Running the application.
To run this a react app might be required, as prompt is a window property which runs on the browser and is not available for node.
If you possess an existing reactJS app, just plug this page in and start your application.
There might be some issues of lag, especially regarding the console display. To fix this issue, reload the browser tab constantly until a proper page reload is achieved (i.e. spam reload button)
Happy Hacking!
